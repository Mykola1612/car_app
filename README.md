provided by the company "/catalogue" - a page containing a catalogue of cars of
different configurations "/favourites" - a page with ads that have been added to
the user's favourites If a user goes to a route that does not exist, they should
be redirect to the home page.

📋 To work with the list of ads, create your own personal backend for
development using the UI service https://mockapi.io/. Create an adverts
resource. Use the resource constructor and describe the advert object as
described below.

type, img, description, fuelConsumption, engineSize, accessories,
functionalities, rentalPrice, rentalCompany, address, rentalConditions, mileage
(see screenshot below). Do not add new fields! To fill the collection, you can
take adverts.json. If the data is missing or incomplete, please add it by
yourself.

✔️ The database should contain at least 32 ads with different values (at your
discretion). Implemented pagination, where one pagination page should contain 12
ads.Pagination should be implemented on the Mockapi side.
